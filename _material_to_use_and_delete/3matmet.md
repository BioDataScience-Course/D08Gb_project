A stratified sample of 224 *Paracentrotus lividus* sea urchins of various sizes (20 to 25 individuals in each 5 mm size-class ranging from 10 to 60 mm in test diameter) was measured. Half of them where directly collected in the field in Morgat, Brittany (France). The others where cultivated specimens from the Marine Station of Luc-sur-Mer, Normandy (France) (see Grosjean et al. 1998 for the protocol), but which field parents originated also from Morgat. In both field and cultivated individuals, half population was measured in September, and half was measured in March in order to assess a possible seasonal variation (Spirlet et al. 1998).

- The diameter is measured to the nearest 0.1 mm with a sliding caliper to the widest part of the sea urchin (the ambitus), and without considering the spines. In case of a possible oval shape, it is the average of two perpendicular diameters taken to the ambitus that is considered.

- The total fresh weight is measured to the nearest 0.001 g after leaving the sea urchins for 5 minutes (stabilization of weight) on absorbent paper, which prevents possible fluctuations due to residual water on the integument surface.

- The immersed weight is a much less customary measurement and its use is further discussed. In the present case, it corresponds to the apparent weight of a sea urchin in sea water. It is assessed with a scale (precision of 0.1%) provided with a plate or basket immerged in a tank of sea water and containing the individuals to be weighed (see Fig. **XXX**).

<!-- TODO: add figure here with this legend:
Data acquisition system. A scale (1), an electronic sliding caliper (2) and a second scale equipped with a plate immersed in a tank filled with sea water (3) are connected to a computer (4) for fast data treatment (a software to acquire data directly from scales and calipers into a PC and to calculate the SIW is freely available from the authors).

Each specimen was measured only once. However, to assess the reproducibility of the 3 types of measure-ment and the possible variation due to the experimenter, an additional 15 echinoids were measured 3 times at a 4 h interval by 7 different people. The individuals were provided in random order to the experimenters. Data were collected by means of a data acquisition system composed of an electronic sliding caliper and electronic scales connected to a computer (Fig. **XXX**).
