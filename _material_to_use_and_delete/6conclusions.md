## Conclusions

The SIW should be used whenever possible both as a reference measurement for indices (gonadal index, repletion index, ...) and for studies involving somatic growth. Test diameter remains the fastest measure, and thus privileged for measuring large number of individuals when accuracy is not of prime importance, or for measures in the field. Fresh weight use should be restricted to the determination of the biomass.
