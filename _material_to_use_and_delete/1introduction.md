## Introduction

<!-- TODO: format bibliographic references correctly -->

*In vivo* determination of the body size is a basic approach used in many fields in biology, including individual growth (Ebert 1967, Grosjean et al. 1996, Régis 1969), population dynamics (Allain 1972, Régis & Arfi 1978), morphometry or biometry (Ebert 1968, 1981, Lawrence et al. 1995, Moss & Meehan 1968), physiology (through calculation of gonadal or repletion indices, for instance Agatsuma & Sugawara 1988, Giese 1966, Nedelec 1983, Spirlet et al. 1998). Various kinds of measurements are available, from lengths to volumes or weights. For echinoids, this task is facilitated by the presence of a rigid endoskeleton that restrains both their external dimensions and their total volume / weight. Hence, several measurements are accessible and used to quantify the body size.

Few studies have compared and discussed the accuracy and suitability of these various measurements, except for the classical relationship between the test diameter and the body weight (Agatsuma & Sugawara 1988, Allain 1972, Kaneko et al. 1981). Consequently, authors use different body size measurements that are not always optimal for their studies.
